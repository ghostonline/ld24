Ludum Dare 24
=============

Code repository for the 24rd installment of the Ludum Dare competition, with 'Evolution' as its theme.

The game is developed in Python, using the Pyglet game library. Graphics are created using the GIMP and Pixen.

In this game, you are in control of an experimental aircraft, able to absorb technology and reapply its component directly in the field. In time, your craft will be able to evolve its weapon systems to better combat the assailants. 

Control with the arrow keys, shoot with 'Z'. If you damage an enemy aircraft enough, it will catch fire and becomes vulnerable for absorption. Move your aircraft closer to steal its remaining shield energy and any tech it contains. When you have collected enough, your weapon systems will evolve. In its final stage, the projectiles will have a small area of effect upon detonation. 

Be careful when approaching burning enemy crafts, though. They might be damaged, but are still able to attack. Note that the kamikaze fighters are too fast to be hit. You will have to dodge them until they run out of fuel.
